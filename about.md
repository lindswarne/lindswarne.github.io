I currently work as a Success Engineer in the Customer Success arm of Bizible (a recent new product of Marketo and even more recently Adobe). At work, I am a user advocate. Once the customer purchases our product, I work with their team to implement technical solutions and collaborate with the product development team ensure all technical requirements are fufilled. While I advise customers everday on our data, I've become more curious about how to analyze data myself. This space is to help me learn to communicate and reflect on my journey.

### More Information

I studed Geography in school and I'm particulary interested in location data. I'm also enjoying learning more about Natural Language Processing.
