title:  "Predicting Boston Housing Prices with Udacity Machine Learning Fundamentals"
---
<b>Project Overview</b>

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, youâ€™ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.

<b>Project Highlights</b>

This project is designed to get you acquainted with the many techniques for training, testing, evaluating, and optimizing models, available in sklearn.

<b>Things you will learn by completing this project:</b>
